this is by no means done, these TODO items are just to help me not to forget ideas i come up with. feel free to suggest stuff,
unless you're greg because greg is ridiculous.

-before killing, send other signals 
-add more fuzz modules
-add more options for getopt() fuzzer, at least allow easily specifying an argument to use after all
 the options to get things like $program -a bla <fuzzstring> to be fuzzed easily. trivial to do.
-document
-nicer usage function (trivial++)
-more commandline options (will come as more modules are written)
-allow capture and archiving of a core dump upon a crash
-extensions/flags to further define the behavior of the getopt() fuzzer, such as allowing the same option two or three times
